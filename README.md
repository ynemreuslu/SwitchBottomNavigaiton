#  SwitchBottomNavigation 🎛️
This project showcases an Android application where Bottom Navigation items are dynamically managed based on switch states on the main screen. It demonstrates how to add, remove, and control the visibility of Bottom Navigation items depending on whether switches are turned on or off.

 # Features:
- **Bottom Navigation Management**: 📲 The Bottom Navigation menu is dynamically updated based on the switch states on the main screen. Items are added or removed from the menu as switches are toggled on or off.
- **Switch Control**: 🔄 Switches on the main screen control the addition, removal, and visibility of items in the Bottom Navigation. These operations are synchronized with the changes in the user interface.
- **Data Management**: 🗄️ Switch states are managed using ViewModel, ensuring that data is preserved across configuration changes.
-  **Lootie**:🎉 The application includes Lootie integration to enhance the user experience.
-  **UI Testing**: 🧪 UI tests ensure the functionality and user experience of the application. Tests are conducted comprehensively to verify that the Bottom Navigation and switch interactions work correctly.
This project is designed to enhance your Android development skills and improve your proficiency in managing dynamic Bottom Navigation items.
