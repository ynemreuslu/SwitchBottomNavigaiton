#  SwitchBottomNavigation 🎛️
This project showcases an Android application where Bottom Navigation items are dynamically managed based on switch states on the main screen. The project demonstrates how to add, remove, and control the visibility of Bottom Navigation items using switches.

 # Features:
- **Bottom Navigation Management**: 📲 The Bottom Navigation menu is dynamically updated based on the switch states on the main screen. Items are added or removed from the menu as switches are toggled on or off.
- **Switch Control**: 🔄 Switches on the main screen control the addition, removal, and visibility of items in the Bottom Navigation. These operations are synchronized with the changes in the user interface.
- **Data Management**: 🗄️ Switch states are managed using ViewModel, ensuring that data is preserved across configuration changes.
This project is designed to enhance your Android development skills and to improve your proficiency in managing dynamic Bottom Navigation items.
